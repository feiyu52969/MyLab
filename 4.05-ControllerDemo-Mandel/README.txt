Controller Demo v1.0

Game Programming Gems 5

Description:
An OpenGL implementation of a PD controller based pose controller, as described in Game Programming Gems 5.  The freely available Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) is used to perform the rigid body simulation of the human figure.  When the example controller is enabled, the demo cycles through simple target poses showing how an under damped, over damped, and critically damped controller might appear.  There is also an option to apply forces to any body part to see that the body still responds to the physical world while being controlled.

Instructions:
The code has been compiled and tested using Microsoft Visual Studio .NET, though it should compile with more recent versions as well as version 6.0.  For instructions on how to use the demo, please press 'h' after launching the executable.
